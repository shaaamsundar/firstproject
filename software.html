                Software is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate a computer and execute specific
                tasks.<br>
                In simpler terms, software tells a computer how to function. It’s a generic term used to refer to
                applications, scripts, and programs that run on devices such as PCs, mobile phones, tablets, and other
                smart devices.
                Software contrasts with hardware, which is the physical aspects of a computer that perform the work.<br>

            <p>The two main categories of software are application software and system software.
                An application is software that fulfills a specific need or performs tasks. System software is designed
                to
                run a computer's hardware and provides a platform for applications to run on top of. Other types of
                software
                include programming software, which provides the programming tools software developers need; middleware,
                which sits between system software and applications;
                and driver software, which operates computer devices and peripherals.</p>

            Software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on a device. It can
            be thought of as the variable part of a computer, while hardware is the invariable part.</p>
